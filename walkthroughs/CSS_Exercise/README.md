## Objective

Practice using CSS rulesets to add styles to web pages.

## Exercise 1

Steps are to be completed in your root directory (`CSS_Exercise/`) and `index.html` file.

1. Create a **new css file**, named `index.css`, in your project's _root directory_
2. Create a **link** element nested in the `<head></head>` of your `index.html` file, that contains an **href** attribute with a value that links to your newly created external stylesheet (don't forget to add a **rel** attribute to describe the linked content as a stylesheet\*)

## Exercise 2

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Add a `nav-link` class name to each **anchor** element on your page.
2. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects all elements with `nav-link` class name
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **text color** of the `nav-link` elements to **orange**
4. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **text decoration** of the `nav-link` elements to **none**, to remove the default underline for links.

## Exercise 3

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects all elements with the `main` tag name
2. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **max width** of the `main` elements to **600px**
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **margin top** and **margin bottom** of the `main` elements to **24px**, to center the `main` elements between the left and right edges of the page (or their containing element).
4. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **margin left** and **margin right** of the `main` elements to **auto**, to center the `main` elements between the left and right edges of the page (or their containing element).

## Exercise 4

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects all elements with the `section` tag name
2. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **margin top** and **margin bottom** of the `section` elements to **24px**, to center the `section` elements between the left and right edges of the page (or their containing element).
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **padding left**, **padding right**, **padding top** and **padding bottom** of the `section` elements to **16px**, to give the `section` elements space between their content and border.

## Exercise 5

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Add a `title` id attribute to the `h1` element in your `index.html` file
2. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects the element with the `title` id
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **font size** of the `title` element to **40px**.
4. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **font weight** of the `title` element to **800**, to give the `title` element's text a _bolded_ font weight.

## Exercise 6

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Add a `d-inline` class name attribute to the current `li` elements in your `index.html` file
2. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects the element with the `d-inline` class name
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **display** of the `d-inline` elements to **inline**, to have each `<li></li>` display as an _inline_ element.

## Exercise 7

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects any `<ul></ul>` element nested as a _child_ of a `<nav></nav>` element. Use the **descendent selector**.
2. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **list style** of the `nav > ul` elements to **none**, to remove the bullet points that are displayed by default for lists.

## Exercise 8

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects the `<body></body>` element.
2. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **background color** of the `<body></body>` element to **#222222**.
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **text color** of the `<body></body>` element's text content to **#EEEEEE**.

## Exercise 9

Steps are to be completed by writing css rulesets in your `index.css` file.

1. Add an `avatar` id attribute to the `<img>` element in your `index.html` file.
2. Create a **ruleset** in your `index.css` file that selects the element with the `avatar` id.
3. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **width** of the `avatar` element to **100px**.
4. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **margin left** and **margin right** of the `avatar` element to **auto**.
5. Create a **declaration** in your new ruleset that changes the **margin top** and **margin bottom** of the `avatar` element to **32px**.
