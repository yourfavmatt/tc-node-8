        HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language and is used to give semantic
        meaning to text on a document.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a look at the syntax rules:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Elements have names</li>
          <li>Elements typically have opening and closings tags</li>
          <li>An element example would be: &lt;h1>&lt;/h1></li>
      </ul>
      <p>HTML has two types of elements: block and inline.</p>
