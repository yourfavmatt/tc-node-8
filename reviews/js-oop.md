# Reviews: JS OOP

Breaking down a program into smaller, more specific tasks (enables _Single Responsibility Principle_)

Using _class notation_ to create models for objects.

Objects created from a class are called _instances_.

By convention, class names are capitalized.

Class values are not hoisted.

Can use the `this` keyword within class methods.

Classes have `constructor` methods that are responsible for creating instances from a class.

Use `new` keyword followed by the class contructor call to _instantiate_ a new instance from a class.

Class Notation is just _syntax sugar_ for _prototypes_ in JS.

Use `Object.create(prototype)` to create an instance from a prototype.

Classes are models of objects with predefined properties and methods.
