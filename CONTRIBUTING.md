# Contributing to this Repository

To contribute to [tc-node-8](https://github.com/Bryantellius/tc-node-8), begin by forking and cloning this repository.

## Pull Requests

Github has a _pull request_ feature that allows users to request that other users pull in their contributions to a project. Pull requests are a very common way that developers contribute to other projects.

### How to Submit a Pull Request

Start by forking and cloning a project on Github. Once you have made local changes and pushed up a new commit, do the following:

1. Find the green **Code** button on your Github page of the project you just pushed to
2. Below that button will be a dropdown titled **Contribute**
3. Click the single single green **Open pull request** button
4. From this new page, find the green **Create pull request** button
5. The following view will allow you to change or add an additional pull request message
6. When ready, submit the pull request by clicking the green **Create pull request** button

And there you go! The owner of the repository will be able to view, comment on, and accept your changes if they see fit to do so.

## Assignments

### First

For your first contribution, start by creating a folder, labeled by your _github username_, under the `answers/` directory (ex: `answers/Bryantellius`).

Complete the following:

1. Create the following file under your newly created folder: `git.csv`
2. Add as many git commands with descriptions that you can. Reference the [Git Handbook](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) if desired.
3. Only add _one_ command/description pair per line, seperating each command and description by a comma. Preferably do not add a title or any other text to the file.

If you need a reference for a started answer, view [answers/Bryantellius/git.csv](/answers/Bryantellius/git.csv).

Be sure to add, commit and push your work back to Github. Once your work is on Github, [submit a pull request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request).

## Notes

If you take notes during class or outside reading, add them to the `notes/` directory under a sub-folder labeled by your _github username_ (ex: `notes/Bryantellius/git-branching.txt`).

Be sure to [submit a pull request](#how-to-submit-a-pull-request) to share your notes with others.
